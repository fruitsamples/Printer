	Contains:	Routines for buffered async i/o.  These routines are necessary for maximal 
                        performance over usb, but might not be needed for other i/o types where the i/o
                        subsystem performs buffered async writes.

 * PMIOCreateHelper
 * 
 * Creates an IO helper.  An IO helper helps optimize the communication between the 
 * PrinterModule and the IOModule, providing buffering and async writing services.  The
 * PMIOCreateHelper will act as a "front" for all of your writes to the i/o module, collect
 * them into reasonably sized buffers, and schedule them for i/o on a special thread.  Used
 * correctly this allows the main printing and converting threads to not wait on i/o.
 *
 * Parameters:  firstBufferSize, size of first buffer (usually small, like 4K)
 * 		nextBufferSize, size of subsequent buffers (usually larger, like 32K)
 * 		job, jobID to call IO write proc
 *		writeProc, the PMIOWriteProcPtr to send data to
